### Performance
- Enhancing performance for anything can be achieved by decluttering also known as debloating. This can be done by removing ONLY UNNECESSARY STUFF. For example in my github instead ofnusing the word and I use & as it uses less characters.

- Probably one of the best ways to achieve performance is by overclocking your hardware! This may sound scary but it really isnt as long as you dont clock it to high.

### Maintenance
- Cleaning dust out of your pc is very important if 




### Information
- Windows vs Linux? Of course Linux is better thats not even a debate. Windows sucks for performance but has good compatibility for some programs that linux dose not support. Linux supports almost anything hardware based because of how lightweight it is. Thats one of the beauty's about linux + Linux has some programs that windows dose not support. (Windows is fat) but if ur games support linux look more into it! I AM NOT SAYING WINDOWS SUCKS I use both Windows & Linux thats just my opinion about both.

### My goOfY projects
- [Being GooFy with windows part 1](https://github.com/Atopsxv/Learn-Tech/releases/GooFy-aH-Script). READ BEFORE PROCEED! Made by me.

### Alternatives for programs
- Best browser right now has to be [Thorium](https://thorium.rocks/) because of how well its made & its great compatibility support. Ive tested myself & got other people to test & noticed a faster difference in website load times. Just an amazing browser try it out!

- Use [ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net) to boot (multible isos) with instead of any other iso file boot tool such as rufus or etcher as you need multiple usbs for 1 iso file to be booted. Here is a [vid](https://youtu.be/EgcC_40wyKs?si=RFZxsYGy8mXAjlnI) on what it is & how to set it up. Keep in mind how much storage is on your usb.
