- Enhancing system performance can be achieved by decluttering your system also known as debloating. This can be done by removing unnecessary apps, folders, & background processors to a certain point. If you delete or tune with the wrong stuff on your system it will not function properly. ONLY THE UNNECESSARY STUFF.

- Use a tool called [ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net) to boot (multible isos) with 1 usb. Here is a [guide](https://youtu.be/EgcC_40wyKs?si=RFZxsYGy8mXAjlnI) on what is it & how to set it up. Use instead of any other iso file boot tool such as rufus or etcher as you need multiple usbs for 1 iso file to be booted. Keep in mind it depends on the size of the usb aswell.
