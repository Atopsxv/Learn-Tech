## Useful-Info
Useful information I think (LET ME KNOW HOW I CAN IMPROVE IT AS THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL! THIS IS MEANT TO BE A LEARNING LIST.

1. Being as minimal as possible by removing as many apps and files as possible and  removing unnecessary code lines from scripts or websites so that everything runs nice and smoothly as there is less text to read. LET ME KNOW IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BUT ITS TRUE WHEN I LOOK AT IT THAT WAY. (CLEAN UP ANYTHING)

2. Why its not recommended to use someone elses custom OS for these [reasons.](/Dont-use-customos.md) Instead follow Amits PC Tuning guide to create your own windows as an alternative. I DIDNT CONTRIBUTE ITS JUST AN AMAZING GUIDE! From my experience
