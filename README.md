### Performance
- Enhancing performance can be achieved by decluttering also known as debloating. This can be done by removing unnecessary stuff such as programs, folders etc.

- Probably one of the best ways to achieve performance is by overclocking your hardware! This may sound scary but it really isnt as long as you dont clock it to high. Although it can shorten the life span of your hardware but is an amazing way to get performance if done correctly.

### Maintenance
- Cleaning dust out of your pc is very important if it has not been done for 5 months or longer as dust builds up on your hardware which can affect the electrical circuits.




### Information
- Windows vs Linux? Of course Linux is better thats not even a debate. Windows sucks for performance but has good compatibility for some programs that linux dose not support. Linux supports almost anything hardware based because of how lightweight it is. Thats one of the beauty's about linux + Linux has some programs that windows dose not support. (Windows is fat) but if ur games support linux look more into it! I AM NOT SAYING WINDOWS SUCKS I use both Windows & Linux thats just my opinion about both.

- [Useful sources,guides & links etc](guides&sources.md). NOT MINE NOR DID I CONTRIBUTE THEY JUST HELPED ME & ARE TRULY AMAZING!

### Alternative programs
- Best browser right now has to be [Thorium](https://thorium.rocks/) because of how well its made & its great compatibility support. Ive tested myself & got other people to test & we noticed faster website load times. Just an amazing browser try it out!

- Use [ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net) to boot (multible isos) with instead of any other iso file boot tool such as rufus or etcher as you need multiple usbs for 1 iso file to be booted. Here is a [vid](https://youtu.be/EgcC_40wyKs?si=RFZxsYGy8mXAjlnI) on what it is & how to set it up. Keep in mind how much storage is on your usb.

- Use [process explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) instead of using task manager as task manager isnt always accurate & process explorer tells you more about whats going on in your pc. Here is [how to set it up.](https://github.com/amitxv/PC-Tuning/blob/main/docs/post-install.md#replace-task-manager-with-process-explorer) Made by [Amit.](https://github.com/amitxv)
