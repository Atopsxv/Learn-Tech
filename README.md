### Performance
- Enhancing performance can be achieved by decluttering your system also known as debloating. This can be done by removing unnecessary stuff such as programs, folders etc.

- Probably one of the best ways to achieve performance is by overclocking your hardware! This may sound scary but it really isnt as long as you dont clock it to high. Although it can shorten the life span of your hardware but is an amazing way to get performance if done correctly.

### Maintenance
- Cleaning dust out of your pc is very important if it has not been done for 5 months or longer as dust builds up on your hardware which can affect the electrical circuits.




### Information
- Windows vs Linux? Of course Linux is better thats not even a debate. Windows sucks for performance but has good compatibility for programs that linux dose not support. Linux supports almost anything hardware based because of how lightweight it is. Thats one of the beauty's about linux + Linux has some programs that windows dose not support. (Windows is fat) but if ur games support linux look more into it. I use both Windows & Linux thats just my opinion about both.
