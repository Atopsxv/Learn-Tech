Your feedback on improving this repository is highly valuable & Be honest with it! This is intended to be an evolving source for tech learning.

- Enhancing performance for anything can be achieved by decluttering also known as debloating. This can be done by removing ONLY UNNECESSARY STUFF.

- Windows vs Linux? Of course linux thats not even debatable. Windows sucks for performance but good for compatibility. Linux supports almost anything hardware based because of how lightweight it is thats the beauty about it. Linux also has programs that windows dose not support. (Windows is fat for gaming) but if ur games support linux look more into it! I AM NOT SAYING WINDOWS SUCKS I still use windows thats just my opinion about both.

- [The truth about unknown custom OSes & What you should do?](custom-windows-info.md)

- [Useful sources](sources.md). NOT MINE NOR DID I CONTRIBUTE THEY JUST HELPED ME & ARE TRULY AMAZING!

- [Being GooFy with windows part 1](https://github.com/Atopsxv/Learn-Tech/releases/GooFy-aH-Script). READ BEFORE PROCEED! Made by me.

### Alternatives for basic programs.
- Use [ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net) to boot (multible isos) with instead of any other iso file boot tool such as rufus or etcher as you need multiple usbs for 1 iso file to be booted. Here is a [vid](https://youtu.be/EgcC_40wyKs?si=RFZxsYGy8mXAjlnI) on what it is & how to set it up. Keep in mind how much storage is on your usb.

- [Legendary Launcher]() aka debloated Epic Games but requires commands with cmd to use it.

- Best browser right now in my opinion go's to [Thorium]()because of how well its made & what it supports.
