# Being real goofy inside windows.

- Services that should be stopped for extra goofyness aka performance. Make script to disable the 3 windows processors. Run script only when game is opened. DONT RUN SCRIPT WHEN MULTI TASKING!

- Testing if these 3 services disabled allows cmd to be visible.

- When you have closed the game. Press control + R then type [cmd]() & click enter. In command prompt type [shutdown.exe /r /t 0]() THIS RESTARTS PC!

- Another mthod instead of restarting pc is by press control + shift + esc to open task manager. then click on file then run new service. Type [explorer.exe]() & Enter. Do the same for the other 2 services. Find name for them i need to.

1. Windows explorer
