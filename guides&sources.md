> [!NOTE]
These where not created by me nor did I contribute. This was intended to be a good list of links, guides etc I personally found useful & amazing.

### Guides

- [Amits](https://github.com/amitxv) | [PC Tuning Guide](https://github.com/amitxv/PC-Tuning) is about how to create your own windows & how to tune your system. JUST AN AMAZING GUIDE.

- [Debloating & having the perfect phone](https://youtu.be/MFbXFG2xDJI?si=1Dh7paiS4QnOl4OZ) by [ChrisTitusTech](https://youtube.com/ChrisTitusTech). This helped battery life on my android A LOT.

- [Making your mouse feel wireless for free.]() DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Make sure you do it multible times on an office mouse or something as this can brick your mouse. But if done correctly your mouse will feel wireless while its wired.

### Links

- Windows XP [ISO FILE](https://archive.org/details/WinXPProSP3x86) Used this in a VM & it worked flawlessly. Activation key in description of site.
