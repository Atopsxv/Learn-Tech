These where not created by me nor did I contribute. This was intended to be a good list of links, guides etc I personally found useful & amazing.
- ([Amits](https://github.com/amitxv)) [PC Tuning Guide](https://github.com/amitxv/PC-Tuning) is about how to create your own windows & how to tune your system. JUST AN AMAZING GUIDE.

- [Debloating & having the perfect phone](https://youtu.be/MFbXFG2xDJI?si=1Dh7paiS4QnOl4OZ) by [ChrisTitusTech](https://youtube.com/ChrisTitusTech). This helped battery life on my android A LOT.

- [Steam alternative](https://github.com/Aetopia/NoSteamWebHelper) to steamwebhelper processors that waste resourses while playing games as steam needs to be running in the background to be able to. Made by [Aetopia](https://github.com/Aetopia). Useful for people who play games on steam such as me.
