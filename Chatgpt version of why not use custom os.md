1. Avoid using a custom OS, especially if you're someone who relies on a customized OS. It's important to be aware that such customizations may introduce hidden malicious activities or malware that can go undetected by virus scans, regardless of their quality.

2. Wondering which OS to choose because you're not satisfied with normal Windows? Consider creating your own custom Windows using [Amits PC Tuning Guide](https://github.com/amitxv/PC-Tuning) instead of opting for a custom OS. This guide, created by [Amit](https://github.com/amitxv), is truly exceptional. I didn't contribute to it, but I can vouch for its effectiveness. I hope more users discover and utilize this guide, as it has significantly improved my experience and can do the same for others seeking a tailored Windows system that maintains compatibility and performance. Keep in mind that it may require time and patience to read and understand, but the results are well worth it, based on my experience. Your mileage may vary depending on your reading and comprehension skills.

3. It's time to dispel the myths around tweaking and boosting FPS, as most of these claims are likely tied to malware. It's better to distance yourself from the tweaking industry and the promises of enhanced performance. These claims are often used to manipulate users into subscribing to their services for long-term gains. However, Amits PC Tuning Guide is a genuine solution, and I can attest to its effectiveness based on my personal experience. I'm not here to criticize the tweaking community, as I used to be part of it myself. But, once I discovered this remarkable guide, I realized its authenticity. I say this because it's the truth, and I'm not someone who opposes everything or claims to know it all. I genuinely hope to see the tweaking industry evolve and improve.
