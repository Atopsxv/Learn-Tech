Why It is not recommended to use a custom os and what to do about it.

Using someone else's custom OS is not recommended due to safety concerns. Instead follow [Amit's PC tuning guide](https://github.com/amitxv/PC-Tuning) for enhanced security and reliability as a custom os can contain malicious activity. This can lead to stolen data or damage to pc that cant be detected by virus scans no matter how well its designed as it comes built into the iso. (I DID NOT HELP OR CONTRIBUTE TO THE GUIDE) I just wish more people would read and follow it step by step as it has help me so much and will help others no matter what you intend to use your windows for while maintaining performance and compatibility. I am not one of those people who thinks they know everything or is against everything because im not as I was once a custom os user aswell but I wanted to share my experience from starting off as a custom os user to realise that they are not safe and found this guide to help me so much to this day.
