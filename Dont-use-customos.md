Why It is not recommended to use a custom os and what to do about it.

Using someone else's custom OS is not recommended due to safety concerns. Instead follow [Amit's PC tuning guide](https://github.com/amitxv/PC-Tuning) for enhanced security and reliability as a custom os can contain malicious activity. This can lead to data stolen or damage to pc that cant be detected by virus scans no matter how well its designed.
