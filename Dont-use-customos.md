# Why Its not recommended to use a custom os and what can you do to replace one because stock windows sucks???




## Using someone else's custom OS is not recommended due to safety concerns like containing malicious activity. This can lead to stolen data or damage to pc that cant be detected by virus scans no matter how well its designed as it comes built into the iso image. The main reason why you should create your own windows os is its much safer & more suited for your needs no matter what you intend to use it for. Another reason is if you have an issue in your windows or error you would know how to fix it.

I am not one of those people who thinks they know everything or is against everything because im not as I was once a custom os user aswell but I wanted to share my experience from starting off as a custom os user to realise that they can not be safe well how would you know whats inside the iso image.
