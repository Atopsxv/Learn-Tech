## Why its not recommended to use a custom os and what can you do to replace it stock windows sucks???

### Why its not safe to use a custom os?
- Using someone else's custom OS is not recommended due to safety concerns like containing malicious activity. This can lead to stolen data or damage to pc that cant be detected by virus scans no matter how well its designed as it comes built into the iso image. The main reason why you should create your own windows os is its much safer & more suited for your needs no matter what you intend to use it for. Another reason is if you have an issue in your windows or error you would know how to fix it. 

### So what can you do instead of using a custom os?
- I recommend [Amits PC Tuning Guide](https://github.com/amitxv/PC-Tuning) to create your own os as you dont have any idea what has been put into a custom iso image. Making your own os suites your needs as its made by you & it allows good performance while maintaining compatibility. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS "BEST OS" its all about personal preference. üëç

### Based of experience
- I am not one of those people who thinks they know everything or is against everything because im not as I was once a custom os user aswell but I wanted to share my experience from starting off as a custom os user to realise that they may not be safe. Well how would you know whats inside the iso image.

- Dont get me started with the tweaking industryüíÄ cant believe random mfs are paying to get there pc tuned when they dont even know each other. The tweaks are most likely tied to malware so if you want a slower pc without noticing go for it otherwise tune it yourself & dont be lazy. Like I said I was once there to & that is sad to see because thats one of my biggest regrets for my pc experience just a bunch of useless info.
