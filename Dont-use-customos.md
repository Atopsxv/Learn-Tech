> Why its not recommended to use a custom os and what can you do to replace it stock windows sucks???

### Why its not safe to use a custom os?
- Using someone else's custom OS is not recommended due to safety concerns like containing malicious activity. This can lead to stolen data or damage to pc that cant be detected by virus scans no matter how well its designed as it comes built into the iso image.

### What is recommended instead of using a random custom os?
- I strongly recommend [Amits PC Tuning Guide](https://github.com/amitxv/PC-Tuning) to create your own windows. This is mainly for tech savy people but its such an amazing guide.
- Alternatives to making your own custom windows: Making your own os suites your needs as its made by you & it allows good performance while maintaining compatibility. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS "BEST OS" its all about personal preference & what you intend to use your os for, what games you play etc. üëç

### What if the guide is to complex?
The only eazy way out is to explore [AtlasOS.](https://atlasos.net) Atlas is used by many people in the community enough users to know that its safe. Its not as effective as making your own custom windows because it has to be made for lots of users to make sure they dont get issues etc.

### Based of experience
- I am not one of those people who thinks they know everything or is against everything because im not as I was once a custom os user aswell been there done that but I wanted to share my experience from starting off as a custom os user to then realise & watch vids do some research etc. After all they may not be safe. Well how would you know whats inside the iso image?

### Enough of the GoOfY aH TwEaKiNg nOnSeNse!
- Dont get me started with the tweaking industryüíÄ cant believe random mfs are paying to get there pc tuned when they dont even know each other or have any clue on what they are doing. The tweaks are most likely tied to malware so if you want a slower pc without noticing go for it otherwise tune it yourself & dont be lazy. Like I said I was once there to & that is sad to see because thats one of my biggest regrets for my pc experience just a bunch of useless info.
