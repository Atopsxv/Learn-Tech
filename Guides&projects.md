> [!NOTE]
These guides & projects where not created by me nor did I contribute. This was intended to be a good list I personally found useful & amazing.

- [Debloating & having the perfect phone.](https://youtu.be/MFbXFG2xDJI?si=1Dh7paiS4QnOl4OZ) Made by [ChrisTitusTech](https://youtube.com/ChrisTitusTech). Helped battery life on my android A LOT.

- [Steam alternative](https://github.com/Aetopia/NoSteamWebHelper) to steamwebhelper processors that waste resourses while playing games as steam needs to be running in the background to be able to. Made by [Aetopia](https://github.com/Aetopia). Useful for people who play games on steam such as me.

- [Making my custom windows + tune pc.](https://github.com/amitxv/PC-Tuning) HELPED ME SO MUCH but requires good understanding about windows.

- [AtlasOS](https://atlasos.net) is a great custom OS because of how many users use it & they try to develop a great windows for the community.
