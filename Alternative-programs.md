### Alternative programs
- Best browser right now has to be [Thorium](https://thorium.rocks) because of how well its made & its great compatibility support. Ive tested myself & got other people to test & we noticed faster website load times. Just an amazing browser try it out!

- Use [ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net) to boot (multible isos) with instead of any other iso file boot tool such as rufus or etcher as you need multiple usbs for 1 iso file to be booted. Here is a [vid](https://youtu.be/EgcC_40wyKs?si=RFZxsYGy8mXAjlnI) on what it is & how to set it up. Keep in mind how much storage is on your usb.

- Use [process explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) instead of using task manager as task manager isnt always accurate & process explorer tells you more about whats going on in your pc. Here is [how to set it up](https://github.com/amitxv/PC-Tuning/blob/main/docs/post-install.md#replace-task-manager-with-process-explorer) Made by [Amit](https://github.com/amitxv).
