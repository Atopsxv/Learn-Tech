1. DO NOT USE A CUSTOM OS! - If you are someone that uses a custom os dont be fooled about the tweaking industry or any of that nonsense as you dont have any idea what malicious activity/malware has been imported into the os that isnt detected by viris scans no matter how good the scanner is.

2. So what os should I use normal windows SUCKS ??? - The answer to this is make your own custom windows with [Amits PC Tuning Guide](https://github.com/amitxv/PC-Tuning) instead of using a custom os. This is such an amazing guide that [Amit](https://github.com/amitxv) made (I DID NOT HELP OR CONTRIBUTE) I just wish more users would use this guide as it has helped me so much and it will help others who wants a perfect windows for whatever you intend to use it for while maintaining compatibility & performance. Although this guide does take time to read and some patience but in the end is 100% worth it from my experience but depends if your good at understanding and reading or not (I am not good at understanding so thats why i said it takes long but would be different to you).

3. Stop the tweaking crap its all fake and is most likely malware. - Just abandon the tweaking industry and How to boost fps sayings etc as that stuff isnt real and is just used to get you brainwashed into their services so they get something in the long run.How ever this guide is the real deal I really mean that from experience. Im not one of those tweaking hatters as I used to be into the tweaking industry myself then I found this amazing guide. I am saying all this as it is the truth and im not one of those people who thinks they know everything or is against everything. However I would like to see people who are into that tweaking industry grow and evolve.
